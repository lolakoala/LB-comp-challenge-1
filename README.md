Static Comp Challenge 1

I chose the subject of my favorite anime director, Hayao Miyazaki. 

The sizes of most elements are hard-coded to keep the content stable when the page size changes. 
I used media queries to make the site responsive, and the layout changes quite a bit for mid-size and for mobile. 
I chose to make the squares into more of a bar navigation system upon breaks for ease of navigation by the user. 
I felt the image was important to keep visible when breaking for mobile without scrolling down, as it is the highlight of the 
site, so I shrank it down quite a bit. 
I made my icons by cropping an existing image, adjusting the border-radius, and adjusting the saturation to make them gray. 
I really enjoyed this project!
